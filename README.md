This is my first attempt at a full stack application using Vue 3.

A food ordering website which allows for basket and login functionality.

To do list:

Basket

> add to basket functionality
> ability to change quantity of items on the basket page.
> ability to delete items on the basket page.
> total price updates as soon as there is a change on the basket page
> should be able to see the number of items in basket from the navbar

Login

> login functionality and ability to add users
> clicking on link on the login page should change the component that is in view
> conditional rendering for the login page
> if clicked add to basket and not logged in, redirect to the login page

Css and Styling

> add link to the home page on the logo
> see what we can add to make some of the pages look better? (low prio)
> add images for products, and complete CSS for product cards
> login and basket on navbar should be icons and not words

Router

> food section should be displayed in the URL instead of section ID
