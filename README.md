This is my first attempt at a full stack application using Vue 3.

A food ordering website which allows for basket and login functionality.


To do list:
> add to basket functionality
> ability to change quantity of items on the basket page.
> ability to delete items on the basket page.
> add images for products, and complete CSS for product cards
> food section should be displayed in the URL instead of section ID
> login functionality and ability to add users
> conditional rendering for the login page
> if clicked add to basket and not logged in, redirect to the login page
> add link to the home page on the logo
> see what we can add to make some of the pages look better? (low prio)
